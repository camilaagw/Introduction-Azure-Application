# Lesson 2: Azure compute services
Azure uses a hierarchical system to keep resources organized and to manage expenses:
![Hierarchy](img/subscription-resource-group-hierarchy.png)
1. Azure Account
2. Subscription level: Used for billing. There can be multiple per account (i.e. one for development and testing, and another for production systems)
2. Resource Groups (tied to a region)

There is a variety of compute services in Azure:
- Virtual Machines
- App Services
- Azure Batch
- Azure Functions
- Container Instances
- Service Fabric
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

This lesson focuses on **Virtual Machines** and **App Services**

## Azure Virtual Machine
A IaaS option giving you full access to the underlying operating system of a compute resource. 
- These can be either Windows or Linux machines, with great availability, scalability and redundancy. 
- These require more on-going maintenance and up-keep by cloud developers.

## Azure App Service
A PaaS option allowing developers to focus more on their apps than the underlying infrastructure. 
- It is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. 
- It supports multiple languages and continuous deployment.
- While they are good for scaling, there is also a limit of up to 14 GB or 4 CPU cores on the highest tier.

## What are their use cases?
- Virtual Machines are usually better when you:
    - Need control of the underlying operating system
    - Are using custom software to support your needs
    - Use custom hosting configurations
- An app service is typically better for lightweight applications and services, especially when you don't have the need for high performance compute services.

## How to choose a region for a compute service?
There are three criteria:
- Service availability - Some services may not be available in a particular region.
- Performance - Latency determines network service performance; are you creating resources for yourself or your end user?
- Cost - Costs of services vary by region. If latency isnâ€™t an issue, you might want to deploy your services in the cheapest region.
